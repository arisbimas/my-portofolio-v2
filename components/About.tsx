              I am a web developer with over 3 years of experience in developing
              web applications. Currently, I am employed as a frontend developer
              at an IT consulting company. I began my career as a freelance
              software developer while still in university, and after graduating
              from Bani Saleh University with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in
              Computer Science, I transitioned into a front-end web developer
              role. I thoroughly enjoy working closely with cross-functional
              teams that encompass technology, business, and design.
